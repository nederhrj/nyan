NYAN
====

NYAN is a news filtering engine written in Python and some Ruby.

It was mainly written for my master's thesis. You can find the details 
[here](http://www.blackmagiclabs.com/portfolio/work/master-thesis.html).

The filter is made up of several programs which pass messages to each other over 
STOMP. I used [CoilMQ](https://github.com/hozn/coilmq/) as a broker.

The *feed_crawler* crawls news sites for news articles.
The *feature_extractor* converts news articles to a gensim feature model.
The *article_ranker* ranks incoming news articles according to a learned user model.
The *user_model_trainer* captures the user's interests in a user model which is 
used by the *article_ranker*.

The programs can be easily used on their own.

The *frontend* is good for fast prototyping.

You should note that most code was written for academic purposes and was never 
used for commercially. Saving complete news articles might not be legal.


How to setup and usage
======================

Basically, the crawler, feature extractor, ranker have to be started. They use a 
config file to connect to the STOMP broker. You should read the corresponding chapter 
in my thesis paper to get the whole setup. 

The front end can be run on Apache with FastCGU. You can find a German how to 
[here](http://uberspace.de/dokuwiki/cool:flask#deployment_mit_fastcgi).

I used [daemontools](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html) to make each program a daemon. 
Some can be run a a daemon without daemontools. However, I don't recommend that.

For model training see shared_models/learn_on_articles.

Testing using Vagrant
=====================

Prerequisites: [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org) and [Vagrant](www.vagrantup.com)

- Add a Centos box: "vagrant box add 'Centos 6.4 x32' http://developer.nrel.gov/downloads/vagrant-boxes/CentOS-6.4-i386-v20130731.box"

- Go to the directory where you've pulled the sources. Start a new virtualbox using "vagrant up". This will automatically create a Centos 6.4 installation with all dependencies.

- Open a shell to your new Centos box ("vagrant ssh"):

-- cd /vagrant
-- sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install coilmq  # message broker
-- sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install numpy  # This needs to be before the requirements.txt install. Don't know why
-- sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install all Python requirements
-- bundle install  # Install all necessary Ruby gems

NOTE: if bundle is not found please do:
    gem install bundle
    rbenv rehash

-- sudo /usr/local/bin/python setup.py install

-- in a python shell execute:
import nltk
nltk.download()

enter:
d punkt


Start the message broker:

-- start CoilMQ: "coilmq &"

Start the frontend:

-- "python frontend/frontend.py --host 0.0.0.0". You can access the login page at [http://127.0.0.1:5001](http://127.0.0.1:5001)

Start the feature extractor as daemon:

-- cd nyan/feature_extractor
-- python main.py start --config ../../config.yaml --log test.log -d"

(Note: You may watch test.log for debug/connection information)

Start the article ranker as deamon:

-- cd nyan/article_ranker
-- "python main.py start --config ../../config.yaml --log test.log -d"

(Note: You may watch test.log for debug/connection information)

Crawl some rss feeds:

-- bin/feed_crawler/feed_crawler.rb -l crawl.log -c bin/feed_crawler/feed-crawler-config.yaml -s bin/feed_crawler/feed_state.yaml
